# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning application that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.  
The model predicts whether a flower belongs to **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.

This project is developed as part of the **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset contains flower measurements:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The dataset includes three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

KNN classifies flowers based on similarity with nearby data points.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## ⚙️ Working of the Model
1. Load the Iris dataset
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Train the KNN model
4. Test the model accuracy
5. Predict the flower species

---

## ✅ Result
The model achieves an accuracy of around **95% or higher** and correctly classifies iris flowers.
