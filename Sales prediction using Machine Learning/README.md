# 📊 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Sales prediction involves estimating future sales based on advertising investments across different platforms.  
In this project, we predict product sales using advertising budgets spent on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** using **Linear Regression**.

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Predict how much of a product will be sold based on:
- TV advertising budget
- Radio advertising budget
- Newspaper advertising budget

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- Columns:
  - TV
  - Radio
  - Newspaper
  - Sales
- Rows: 200+
- Dataset cleaned by removing blank/unnamed columns

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Train-test split
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Visualize relationships
7. Predict sales using user input

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- TV Advertising vs Sales
- Radio Advertising vs Sales
- Newspaper Advertising vs Sales
- Actual vs Predicted Sales

These graphs help understand feature impact and model accuracy.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

---

## 🧪 Sample Prediction
The model allows user input for advertising budgets and predicts expected sales.
