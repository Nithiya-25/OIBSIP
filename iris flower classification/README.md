Iris Flower Classification 🌸

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning application that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.
The model predicts whether a flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

This project is developed as part of the Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset contains flower measurements:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

The dataset includes three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

🧠 Algorithm Used

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN classifies flowers based on similarity with nearby data points.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib

⚙️ Working of the Model

Load the Iris dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Train the KNN model
Test the model accuracy
Predict the flower species

✅ Result
The model achieves an accuracy of around 95% or higher and correctly classifies iris flowers.

🚀 How to Run
